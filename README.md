## About the project
This repository contains a programming project code for a chatbot that simulates a conversation between friends. 
A specific topic about soccer and some scattered topics are covered. Moreover, the chatbot can now use Google Geocoding API to convert urban addresses and display them in a meaningful way in our chatbox, after I finsihed the individual part. Last, it can use Google Static Maps API to embeds images into conversation.

## Prepare stage
before we start running this code we need to download several libraries
```bash
pip install nltk
pip install -U spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
pip install pyspellchecker
pip install -U textblob
```

## How to run the code
First, setup the libraries and open the project.
Second, open and run the "socket_server.py".
Last, while the terminal show the chatbot is ready,
use command line or anaconda to enter "python chatbox.py".
Then the chatbot will show up with a GUI.

## Some features

2. The system can remove suffixes (e.g.playing and play) and 
convert all the words back to root form (e.g. apples and apple)

3. The system can clean all the words with not much meaning in the sentence (e.g. 'a', 'is')

4. The system can perform sentiment analysis ï¼ˆe.g. good and bad)
